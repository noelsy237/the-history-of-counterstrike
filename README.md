# Notes

## Idea
The idea came to me as I was browsing examples of one page sites. I came across [this site](http://jessandruss.us/), which I think does the timeline-style site really well. I linked it to one of my hobbies (gaming) and decided to make a timeline for one of my favourite game series, Counter-Strike.

## Design Process
I based the main design off a more simplified version of the previous timeline website I mentioned. Upon inspecting that website I noticed that they used images as the structure of the timeline. I do not have the artistic skills to create images like those, so I used a combination of divs and image borders.

Some of the images I used were found online, and some were screenshots I took from the games themselves.

For the transitions/interactivity for each image I tried to come up with a different idea for each.
## Difficulties and Improvements

I feel like the way I wrote the HTML/CSS was not ideal, but I could not think of any other way to write it if I wanted to achieve the same affect. With every entry to the timeline, another layer of complexity to the project was added. In the end it became a clutter of images, captions etc. all with their own ID's which made the CSS and HTML feel very cluttered.
Overall it was a good learning experience for me, especially using javascript to add some extra interactivity to the webpage.
